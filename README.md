# My Top Skills in SQL
## Data Definition Language (DDL)

- Creating and altering database objects like tables.
- Managing constraints and keys to ensure data integrity.
- Defining and managing database schemas.

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### Sub-queries

I excel at crafting sub-queries to retrieve and manipulate data within complex queries. Sub-queries help me efficiently retrieve specific subsets of data from a larger dataset.

### Joins

I'm skilled in using various types of joins, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, to combine data from multiple tables and extract meaningful insights.

### String Functions

I have a deep understanding of SQL string functions, which allow me to manipulate and format text data effectively. These functions help me clean and process data for analysis.

### Math Functions

I utilize SQL math functions to perform calculations and aggregations on numerical data. These functions help me extract valuable insights and metrics from datasets.

### Window Functions

Window functions enable me to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. I use them for tasks like calculating moving averages, ranking data, and identifying trends over time.

### Common Table Expressions (CTE)

CTEs are a powerful tool for creating temporary result sets within SQL queries. I leverage CTEs for complex queries and simplifying code readability.

## Tools

In addition to SQL, I'm proficient in using the following tools to enhance my data analysis and reporting capabilities:

- Microsoft Excel: I use Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- Power BI: I create interactive and insightful reports and dashboards to communicate data-driven insights effectively.

Feel free to explore the code and projects in my repositories to see how I apply these SQL skills and tools to solve real-world data challenges.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
